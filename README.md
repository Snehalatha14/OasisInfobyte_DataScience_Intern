## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
#### Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor,and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

## Task 3:Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning
### The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower, and the mileage it gives many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.

## Project Description

### In order to anticipate future automobile costs, a project to predict car prices uses machine learning algorithms to analyze previous data on car pricing. This entails gathering a tonne of information over time on various auto models, their features, and their costs. 
### The next stage is to select a suitable machine learning model and train it on the data after the data has been gathered and organized. In order for the model to learn the patterns and relationships between the various variables and their impact on the price, it must be fed past data on automobile prices. 
### After the model has been trained, it can then be used to predict future car prices based on new data inputs. For example, if a new car model is released, the model can analyze its features and predict its price based on historical data.

## Task 4: Email Spam Detection With Machine Learning
#### Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, pushing content.
#### In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use Machine Learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam.
