## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
#### Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor,and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
